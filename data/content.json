      "I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, working in the Quantum Photonics & AI Group under Professor Dirk Englund. My research specializes in AI for Science, quantum optics, and photonics, with a strong focus on leveraging machine learning to tackle complex physics and engineering challenges.",
      "I develop novel physics-informed ML frameworks (PINNs, Neural Operators, Bayesian Inference) to create surrogate models and solve inverse problems in semiconductor fabrication. My work also involves designing and optimizing photonic crystal cavities for quantum information processing and building automated characterization systems that integrate optical metrology with ML-driven data analysis.",
      "Before MIT, I completed dual degrees from √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay and Institut d'Optique Graduate School, with specialization in Quantum Technologies. I have research experience from prestigious institutions including University of Cambridge (Cavendish Laboratory), Coll√®ge de France, and NTT Research."
